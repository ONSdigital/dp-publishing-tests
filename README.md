ONS publishing platform acceptance tests
================

Acceptance tests for the publishing platform for [ons.gov.uk](https://www.ons.gov.uk).

## Getting started

You'll either need access to an environment with the publishing platform running or you'll need to run the [publishing platform locally](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md#publishing).

Before running anything against an environmen you'll need to run the command
```
make install
```

There are a few options on how the tests can be run:

### On an environment
If you have access to a live environment and want to run the full test suite:
```
PUBLISHING_ENV_URL=https://publishing.develop.onsdigital.co.uk ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<password for florence@magicroundabout.ons.gov.uk account>' TEMP_USER_PASSWORD='<password for temporary user created by tests>' make test
```

### On a local machine
To run the whole test suite locally (which assumes Florence is being run on it's default bind address of `:8081`) you'll need to run:
```
ROOT_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<password for florence@magicroundabout.ons.gov.uk account>' TEMP_USER_PASSWORD='<password for temporary user created by tests>' make test-local
```

### Configuration

The following environment variables are available when running the tests:
